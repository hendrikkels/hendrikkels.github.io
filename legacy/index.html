						During my tenure as a Data Analytics manager at PwC, I've spearheaded several transformative projects that
						have significantly enhanced our analytics capabilities and client services. One of my key achievements was
						leading the development of a large-scale analytics platform using Angular and Node.js. This innovative
						platform not only streamlined the process of creating and onboarding analytics but also improved business
						lineage, ultimately enabling faster delivery of insights to our clients. In parallel, I architected and
						implemented cloud-based data pipelines on Azure, leveraging services such as Azure DevOps. This initiative
						resulted in marked improvements in data processing efficiency and real-time analytics capabilities, further
						solidifying our position as industry leaders.
					</p>
					<p class="block-par">
						My role has also involved developing custom analytics solutions that have empowered our clients to make
						data-driven decisions with confidence. I've particularly focused on enhancing SAP data visualization
						capabilities, which has led to increased knowledge and interest in ERP systems among our clientele.
						Throughout these projects, I've maintained a steadfast commitment to industry-specific data privacy
						compliance and best-practice coding standards. My experience in managing cross-functional projects has
						consistently resulted in on-time and within-budget deliveries, fostering efficient collaboration across
						teams. Additionally, I've applied machine learning models for Optical Character Recognition, creating a
						robust document digitization tool that has proven invaluable for clients requiring contract analysis. These
						diverse experiences have not only contributed to PwC's success but have also continually expanded my
						expertise in the rapidly evolving field of data analytics.

						My journey at Methys as a software engineer has been marked by continuous growth and diversification of
						skills. Initially focused on mobile and web application development, I quickly evolved into a Full-Stack
						role, showcasing versatility across various technologies. This transition involved developing and
						maintaining front-end solutions for iOS and Android applications using React Native or native technologies,
						as well as creating websites and web apps with React. Simultaneously, I honed my back-end development
						skills, working with a diverse tech stack including PHP, TypeScript, Node.js, and Python. This comprehensive
						approach allowed me to deliver end-to-end solutions, enhancing our ability to meet complex client needs.
					</p>
					<p class="block-par">
						As my expertise grew, I was promoted to the roles of System Architect and Business Analyst, which broadened
						my responsibilities significantly. In these positions, I was instrumental in bridging the gap between client
						visions and technical realities. I created detailed Business Requirement Documents, set up and scaffolded
						new projects, and worked closely with clients to transform their ideas from concepts to functional products.
					</p>
					<p class="block-par">
						My role expanded to include DevOps responsibilities, where I gained experience in setting up AWS server
						instances and managing deployments. This period also saw me developing crucial soft skills such as team
						management, business development, functional planning, and time management. Later, my role further evolved
						to encompass project scoping, team leadership, and the introduction of a new system for managing project
						details and company intellectual property. This multifaceted experience at Methys has not only enhanced my
						technical prowess but also developed my ability to oversee complex projects from inception to completion.

						A groundbreaking self-service continuous analytics platform, addressing the growing

						enabling instant results generation without deep technical knowledge. This innovative solution significantly
						reduced the overhead of creating client-specific analytics and dramatically shortened the time required to
						deliver analytic results. The platform not only enhanced our operational efficiency but also provided
						crucial business lineage for teams and clients, marking a significant advancement in our data-driven
