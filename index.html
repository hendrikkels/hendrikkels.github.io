I have also become more skilled in DevOps through being tasked with setting up AWS server instances and handling deployment.

					A fintech web-application written in Node.js and Next.js, dedicated to connecting businesses that require funding for their internal projects by managing complex financial information so that tradeing can occur safely and securely by witholding certain shipment documents until payments are settled. The application also allows users to communicate, follow and view other businesses on the platform through a news feed.
